/**

 * allocates on a path is a fixed cost plus noise, and the noise (a GC safepoint, a deoptimisation, a
 * profiling or sampling allocation, a tier change) only ever adds bytes, so the smallest window is the
 * stable estimator of the fixed cost and a mean or median is not. When two paths are compared their
 * windows are interleaved, so a slow drift in the JVM's state affects both alike instead of one.
